# Linked_List Vs Array
---
* memory is like a collection of boxes
* array is normal list
* linked_list is nodes connected
---
### **Access Element**
* Array: Can access element very fast, usually by index: list_1[0] -> O(1)
* Linked_list: Have to travel through the sequence -> O(n)
---
### **Insert Element**
* Array: insert at ith position will have to **shift** many/all values by an amount -> O(n)
* Linked_list: insert at any place if you know the position of connecting nodes -> O(1)
---
### **Delete Element**
* Array: shift elements -> O(n)
* Linked_list: same as above
