# Hash Table:
---
* Cache: Using Hash_Table to memorize data instead of recalculating
---
* Collision:
- Normally, search/delete/insert time = O(1) => Very fast
- A linked list is mapped to a value_slot in the hash table
  * Making the search/delete/insert = O(n). Like Normal linked_list
---
* Load Factor: number of used slots / predetermined_len(slots)
